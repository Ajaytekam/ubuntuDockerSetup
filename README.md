# Ubuntu Docker Setup

Sets up the ubuntu VM using using vagrant to run and build docker containers.  

__How to use :__   

* Install virtualbox and vagrant
* Make a directory `MyData` to current working directory 
* Run `vagrant up` command in the working directory and make sure the [vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) is there.  

> Note: The vagrantfile allocates 6GB ram and 4 cores to vm, so make sure that your system will acomodate that.
